            I'm Mike Caiati, a passionate software developer with an addiction to creating efficient and practical applications. With over 7 of years of experience in the software industry, I have strengthened my skills in various programming languages and frameworks.

          <br />
          <p>
            I have experience in creating applications using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also experienced in Node.js and working with server-side applications, while using Postgres for database management and ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing tennis, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm always eager to learn and start ambitious new projects that challenge my skills and push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
          </p>

            You can reach me on LinkedIn, GitHub, or from the Contact section of this site. I'm excited to connect and see what we can build next!
